# CVE-2023-24203-and-CVE-2023-24204

# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, web applications remain a prime target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. Recently, two critical vulnerabilities were discovered in the SourceCodester Simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System v1.0: CVE-2023-24203 and CVE-2023-24204. These vulnerabilities, involving Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, pose significant risks including arbitrary code execution and unauthorized access. Understanding these vulnerabilities and their impacts is essential for developers and security professionals to safeguard systems from potential threats.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a web application allows users to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, data theft, and further exploitation. XSS vulnerabilities can be classified into three main types:

1. **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database, message forum, or comment field.
2. **Reflected XSS:** The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server.
3. **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

### SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a type of vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code into a query. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and other malicious activities. SQL Injection typically occurs due to insufficient input validation and lack of parameterized queries. Key impacts of SQL Injection include:

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to a system.
2. **Data Theft:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive information from the database.
3. **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can alter, insert, or delete data within the database.

In this blog post, we will delve into CVE-2023-24203 and CVE-2023-24204, exploring the specifics of these vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts, and mitigation strategies. Understanding these vulnerabilities in depth is crucial for protecting your applications and data from potential exploits.
